  A few months ago did a demo at the Bristol WinOps Meetup showing an example Azure DevOps Release Pipeline for
  PowerShell modules. I told everyone I'd get a blog post up "soon" with more information, so here it is; better
  late than never! I'll go over the goals for the example PowerShell Module, then break down the Release Pipeline
  tasks for Azure DevOps.

## Introduction

A few months ago did a demo at the [Bristol WinOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bristol-WinOps-Meetup/events/256620903/)
showing an example Azure DevOps Release Pipeline for PowerShell modules. I told everyone I'd get a blog post up "soon"
with more information, so here it is; better late than never!

I'll go over the goals for the example PowerShell Module, then break down the Release Pipeline tasks for Azure DevOps.
