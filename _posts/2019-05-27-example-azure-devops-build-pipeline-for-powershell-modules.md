## Introduction

A few months ago did a demo at the [Bristol WinOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bristol-WinOps-Meetup/events/256620903/)
showing an example Azure DevOps Build Pipeline for PowerShell modules. I told everyone I'd get a blog post up "soon"
with more information, so here it is; better late than never!

I'll go over the goals for the example PowerShell Module, then break down the Build Pipeline tasks for Azure DevOps.

## Goals for the Example PowerShell Module (PSvCloud)

PSvCloud was a very old PowerShell module I started working on several years ago whilst I was using VMware vCloud
every day. I changed jobs shortly after starting it, so didn't add much. However, it was good enough as an example
module for the Azure DevOps Build Pipeline.

I applied the latest methods and best practices learned at the time to PSvCloud, with a focus on the process around  
[The Release Pipeline Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/whitepapers#the-release-pipeline-model) (Source > Build > Test > Release).

### Source

Git was used with the practical [common flow](https://commonflow.org/) branching model.

### Build

[psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) was used to develop build scripts that can be used both locally using
[Task Runners in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks), and by a CI/CD system like
[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/).

This covers:

- Compiling separate function files into a single .psm1 module.
- Automatically updating documentation in Markdown, ready for a 3rd-party like
[ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Test

Testing the compiled code for known issues and ensuring it aligned to defined standards.

This covers:

- Code analysis using PSScriptAnalyzer.
- Code testing (unit, and common) using Pester.

### Release

Publishing the module build artifact to multiple Azure DevOps Artifacts (NuGet) feeds; one per environment. Each
environment shows the current version available using Status Badges:

## Build Pipeline Tasks for Azure DevOps

For the build pipeline definition I opted for the YAML method, opposed to GUI method. Using a YAML file allowed me
to save the file within my repo alongside all other files under source control.

I'll go over each build step below, but you can also view the complete file,
[azure-pipelines.yml](https://dev.azure.com/adamrushuk/PoC/_git/PowerShellPipeline?path=%2Fazure-pipelines.yml&version=GBmaster).

### build.ps1

You'll notice below that every task name is passed to a script called
[build.ps1](https://dev.azure.com/adamrushuk/PoC/_git/PowerShellPipeline?path=%2FBuild%2Fbuild.ps1&version=GBmaster).
This script is responsible for bootstrapping the environment - ensuring all dependencies are installed - initialising
environment variables, and finally invoking the specified build task(s).

### Init

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -TaskList 'Init'
  displayName: "Install Dependencies"
```

The **Init** task includes the `-ResolveDependency` switch which triggers the use of **PSDepend**.
**PSDepend** uses the
[psvcloud.depend.psd1](https://dev.azure.com/adamrushuk/PoC/_git/PowerShellPipeline?path=%2FBuild%2Fpsvcloud.depend.psd1&version=GBmaster)
config file to install the required PowerShell modules.

### CombineFunctionsAndStage

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -TaskList 'CombineFunctionsAndStage'
  displayName: "Combine PowerShell functions into single module file"
```

The **CombineFunctionsAndStage** task combines all public and private PowerShell functions into single module file,
then stages other required folders and files like `/Documentation`, `/Examples`, and `README.md`.

### Analyze

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -TaskList 'Analyze'
  displayName: "Analyze"
```

The **Analyze** task runs **PSScriptAnalyzer** against the code to ensure quality and best practices are used.

### Test

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -TaskList 'Test'
  displayName: "Test"
```

The **Test** task runs the **Pester** tests located in
[/Tests](https://dev.azure.com/adamrushuk/PoC/_git/PowerShellPipeline?path=%2FTests&version=GBmaster).

### UpdateDocumentation

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -TaskList 'UpdateDocumentation'
  displayName: "Update Documentation"
```

The **UpdateDocumentation** task uses **PlatyPS** to create new documentation markdown files from the comment-based
help within each PowerShell function.

### CreateBuildArtifact

```yaml
- powershell: |
    .\Build\build.ps1 -TaskList 'CreateBuildArtifact'
  displayName: "Create Build Artifact"
```

The **CreateBuildArtifact** task creates a versioned zip file of all staged files.

### PublishTestResults

```yaml
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  displayName: "Publish Pester Tests"
  inputs:
    testRunner: "NUnit"
    searchFolder: "Artifacts"
    testRunTitle: "PesterTests"
  condition: always()
```

The **PublishTestResults** task publishes any Pester results files (NUnitXml) it finds in the Artifacts folder.

### PublishBuildArtifacts 1

```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: "Publish Artifact: PowerShell Module Zipped for offline use"
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: Artifacts
    ArtifactName: Artifacts
  condition: always()
```

The first **PublishBuildArtifacts** task publishes the versioned PowerShell zip file, which is ready to download
for offline use.

### PublishBuildArtifacts 2

```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  displayName: "Publish Artifact: PowerShell Module"
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: Staging
    ArtifactName: PSModule
  condition: always()
```

The second **PublishBuildArtifacts** task publishes the whole `/Staging` folder as is (not zipped), to be used in the
Release Pipeline.
