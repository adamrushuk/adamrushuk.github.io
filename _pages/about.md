## Who am I?

My name is Adam Rush and I'm a DevOps Engineer based in Bristol, UK.

I've been into computing since I was a lad, and have learned something new almost every day; applying my
life-long learning attitude.

I love most things IT but my main interests are in Automation, IT Infrastructure, and experimenting with new
technologies.

My current focus areas are:

- Azure
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- CI/CD Pipelines

## What is the "Hype-Pipe"?

The "Hype-Pipe" is a term myself and good friend / colleague [Matt Horgan](http://matthorgan.xyz/) use to mock
ourselves when we inevitably find ourselves "hyping" on some idea / technology / process / ANYTHING!

## What will I find on this blog?

Mainly posts about stuff I'm working on day-to-day. I'm quite forgetful so they serve as a great source of
reference, and I've learned from my [old blog](http://www.virtuallyimpossible.co.uk) that they also help
others overcome the same challenges. It's good to give back as I've learned so much from other blogs over the
years.

## Anything else?

I've studied hard in the past with a focus on IT certifications as a means of structured learning, which
worked really well for me and I enjoyed attaining them all, including:

- Microsoft MCSE / MCITP:Enterprise Administrator / SQL / Exchange
- VMware VCP-Cloud / VCP
- Cisco CCNA
- Citrix CCA / CCAA

These days I'm taking a more casual approach to studying for exams, but when I do, I'm focussing on [Azure
Certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-exams.aspx) and have gained the following Azure
certs so far:

- `AZ-900` Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
- `AZ-104` Microsoft Azure Administrator
- `AZ-500` Azure Security Engineer Associate
