## Who am I?

My name is Adam Rush and I’m a passionate pseudo-geek based in Bristol, UK.

I've been into computing since I was a lad, and have learned something new almost every day; applying my life-long
learning attitude.

I love most things IT but my main interests are in Automation (especially PowerShell), IT Infrastructure, and
experimenting with new technologies.

My current focus areas are:

- Azure
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Docker

## What is the "Hype-Pipe"?

The "Hype-Pipe" is a term myself and good friend / colleague [Matt Horgan](http://matthorgan.xyz/) use to mock
ourselves when we inevitably find ourselves "hyping" on some idea / technology / process / ANYTHING!

## What will I find on this blog?

Mainly posts about stuff I'm working on day-to-day. I'm quite forgetful so they serve as a great source of
reference, and I've learned from my [old blog](http://www.virtuallyimpossible.co.uk) that they also help others
overcome the same challenges. It's good to give back as I've learned so much from other blogs over the years.

## Anything else?

I've studied hard in the past with a focus on IT certifications as a means of structured learning, which worked
really well for me and I enjoyed attaining them all, including:

- Microsoft MCSE / MCITP:Enterprise Administrator / SQL / Exchange
- VMware VCP-Cloud / VCP
- Cisco CCNA
- Citrix CCA / CCAA

I've spent the last year or so taking a more casual approach to learning, but I'm back on the wagon now,
focussing on the many [Azure Certification Exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-exams.aspx).
